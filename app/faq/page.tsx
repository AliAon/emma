    question: "How much can I save by getting surgery abroad?",

    question: "What does ‘all-inclusive experience’ mean?",
    answer:

    id: 5,
    question: "Will I still have direct contact with my surgeon?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Once connected, you'll be in direct communication with your surgeon and their team. Emma simply helps you find the right fit; your medical relationship is always between you and your doctor.",

      "Your surgeon will provide clear instructions and follow-up care. Many packages include extended recovery support. We also guide you on what’s covered so you feel supported every step of the way.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Do I need to speak Spanish?",
    answer: "Not at all. Most of our surgeons and their staff speak English.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer:
      "It’s simple: complete a short intake with Emma, review your matched surgeons, and choose the one that best fits your needs. From there, your journey is personalized, safe, and stress-free.",
